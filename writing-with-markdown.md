# Writing with Markdown

While you may be unfamiliar with the name, Markdown is widely used by developers and applications all over the internet, and even if you haven't heard the name, you may actually be familiar with what it does. WhatsApp, for example:

Markdown allows us to create and edit rich documents, like the ones you'd normally use things like Open Office or Microsoft Word to create, without having to leave you keyboard to format text by using your mouse to click on a toolbar item.

## Why?

As a developer, besides the fact that your mouse can often be a speed bump, you will still be required to write documentation, pull requests and tickets/issues in a neat way. GitHub knew this a long time ago and has implemented Markdown, site wide, to make community and team development a lot neater and easier to use for non-developers.

Pull Requests, for example, are a major part of Agile Development. When it comes time to add your brand new feature into your main branch \(All this will be covered later\), <!--NOTE: Do you not want to make the Markdown chapter after the Git and Github one?)--> the descriptions for the pull requests can get very detailed. Using Markdown to break up the plain text into sections with titles and code blocks \(for examples\) can make these a lot easier to read and understand.

Beyond GitHub there are many other developer frameworks for documentation and even entire websites that can be created using Markdown. There are also many editors for Markdown that allow you to preview while you type to make the process a little easier, especially if you're newer to Markdown, not to mention packages/extensions for almost every IDE/Code Editor.

Mou is one of the most popular editors for MacOS:

The Ghost blogging platform allows you to write entirely in Markdown:

## Using Markdown

Markdown is so extensively used on the internet that many, many tutorials and websites dedicated to this purpose already exist. As such, we're not going to reinvent the wheel, with most complete documentation being [How to Write Faster, Better & Longer: The Ultimate Guide to Markdown](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)
