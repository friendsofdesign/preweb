# Writing with Markdown

While you may be unfamiliar with the name, but Markdown is widely used by developers and applications all over the internet and may actually be familiar with what it does. WhatsApp, for example:

Markdown allows us to create and edit rich documents, like the ones you'd normally use things like Open Office or Microsoft Word to create, without having to leave you keyboard to format text by using your mouse to click on a toolbar item.

## Why?

As a developer, besides the fact that your mouse can often be a speed bump, you will still be required to write documentation, pull requests and tickets/issues in a neat way. GitHub knew this a long time ago and has implemented Markdown, site wide, to make community and team development a lot neater and easier to use for non-developers.

Pull Requests, for example, are a major part of Agile Development. When it comes time to add your brand new feature into your main branch \(All this will be covered later\), the descriptions for the pull requests can get very detailed. Using Markdown to break up the plain text into sections with titles and code blocks \(for examples\) can make these a lot easier to read and understand.
