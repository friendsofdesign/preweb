# Working with Git and GitHub

> Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS \(hence Distributed Version Control System\). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion \(also known as SVN\), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

While the above link can give an excellent technical explanation about performance and security, as students it may not seem helpful at all. However, it will be a great read once the terminology is broken down.

Git is a Revision Control, although it can be referred to as Version Control sometimes. Like with Markdown, you may not have heard of this before, but you have probably seen it in action. Dropbox, for example, has a feature that allows you to list all the previous changes on a file, this is Revision Control.
